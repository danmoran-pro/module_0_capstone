## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
  - A hash has key value pairs.
  You can access things from an array by using their index

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

  - pet_store = {leashes: 2, collars: 3, toys: 10}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
  - states.keys
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
  - you can access things by its keys or values
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
